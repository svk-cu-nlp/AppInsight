Review
"The app duplicates notes, creating multiple conflicting versions even though I'm only editing them on one device. (You can imagine how this blows up the monthly storage used.) I searched this issue on the web, and it has been going on for several years on multiple devices, not just Android. Seems like plenty of time for Evernote to get it right!"
"The Evernote app for Android now will not save my notes at all even though I keep hitting the green arrow at the top left corner of the screen. Sometimes when I edit a note and try to save it, the updated notes disappear before my eyes. At other times, the app makes a duplicate copy of the note for no apparent reason. The Android app for Evernote has become unusable. All of the bad reviews show that this is a big problem for many people."
"This app consistently does strange things when editing notes - deletes random words or whole paragraphs when backspacing once or tapping enter, cursor jumps to random places, locks up, etc. It also constakes takes 15 seconds or more to open - frustrating when you're in the middle of something and just want to make a quick update. The latest issue, I can't see any of my notes or notebooks from the app since a recent update. The web interface works great, but the Android app is terrible."
"Constantly struggles to sync my notes across Mac and phone and it will make duplicate notes with different information saved in each note, so I have to then spend time cross-checking and making sure I don't delete the wrong note and that everything I wrote is in the one I save. The problem is especially bad with the scratch pad"
"Garbage! Doesn't share notes! I tried sharing notes from my phone to my friend's phone and from my friend's phone to my phone using the email address used for each account, but I couldn't get either phone to display the notes from the other phone. It should update on the app, but instead you get an email notification that sends you to the app and nothing new shows up. I tried clicking on the sync selection in the settings menu and even restarting both phones, but sharing notes didn't work."
