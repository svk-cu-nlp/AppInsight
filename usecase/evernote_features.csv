Search Dropdown
Search features

There are four sections in the search dropdown: Search suggestions, Go to..., Add filter, and Saved searches. These suggestions are powered by an algorithm that predicts what may be relevant to you based on various factors, such as prior searches and recent activity.

Search suggestions
Search suggestions are located at the top of the dropdown list that appears when you click or tap into the search bar and are indicated by a magnifying glass icon on the left. Clicking on a search suggestion will run the suggested search.

Saved searches
If you have saved searches set up, those will appear below search suggestions.

To create a new saved search, simply execute a search, then click or tap the More actions button (three dots) at the top of the note list panel and select Save search.... To change the name of a saved search, or delete it altogether, run the saved search, click or tap the same three dots at the top of the note list panel, then select Edit saved search... or Delete saved search.

If you do not have any saved searches, this section will not appear in your search dropdown.

Learn more >>

Go to...
This section suggests specific notes, notebooks, and spaces. Selecting one of these will directly open that particular note or notebook, helping you get to where you need faster.

Add filters
Search filters allow you to quickly search for notes that contain a specific type of content. These filters may appear in the search dropdown if you have this type of content. Alternatively, you can type the name of the filter into the search bar, then click or tap on the filter name to apply it. Note that the filter will not appear if you do not have notes with that type of content.

Searching without punctuation
Evernote can search your content even when there are variations of punctuation between the entered text and the actual spelling in the note. Some examples include:

Dash - Results for ""check-in"" can be searched by ""check,"" ""in,"" or ""checkin""
Underscore - Results for ""customer_id_number"" can be searched by ""customer,"" ""id,"" ""number,"" or ""customeridnumber""
Period - Results for ""R.S.V.P."" can be searched by ""rsvp""
Apostrophe - Results for ""O'Connor"" can be searched by ""connor"" or ""oconnor""
URL - Results for ""http://www.evernote.com/download"" can be searched by ""www,"" ""evernote,"" ""com,"" ""download,"" or ""evernotecom"""
PDF and Document search,"With Evernote, you can search PDFs created from:

Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, or other office and word processing applications (Evernote Premium and Business only)
Scanned documents
Which types of scanned PDFs are searchable?
Scanned PDFs with clear, typed text (handwriting is not searchable inside PDFs)
PDFs that do not already contain text that you can select or copy
PDFs with at least one page with a small image (1025 pixels of image data)
PDFs less than 100 pages long
PDFs less than 25 MB in size
PDFs that are not password-protected
PDFs that are not corrupted or unreadable
Troubleshooting: If scanned PDFs are not appearing in your search results
Sync Evernote. It can take up to 4 hours for Evernote to recognize text in newly attached PDFs. If you encounter sync errors, check here for troubleshooting suggestions. Note: If you are working with a local notebook, PDFs inside that notebook are not synced and will not be searchable. Move the note into a synced notebook.
Search Evernote for a word you know is inside the scanned PDF. If the word isn't found, the file is not indexed for search.
Open the PDF in Adobe Reader or your PDF viewer and try selecting text in the file. If the text is selectable, it should show up in Evernote search. If text is not selectable, your PDF is probably scanned images and you need Evernote Premium for the text to be recognized.
Contact us for additional help."
Boolean search,"Advanced search syntax gives you the ability to search your notes using special search commands, like by the date they were created, a specific tag, or the type of content they contain (audio, images, etc.)

Geographic search: Find notes based on the location they were created using latitude, longitude, and radius.

Boolean search: Boolean search is a type of search where you can combine keywords with operators (or modifiers). You can search in Evernote using AND, OR, NOT, and ( )."
Handwriting search,"Did you know that when you snap a photo or attach an image to a note, Evernote can find and identify text ? including handwritten text ? inside that image?

How it works
Typewritten text and handwritten notes that are in JPG, PNG, or GIF file format are evaluated by our indexing system. Text found within an image will be evaluated if it matches one of the following orientations within a few degrees:

0ø ? normal horizontal orientation
90ø ? vertical orientation
270ø ? vertical orientation
Text that does not match one of these orientations will be ignored (including diagonal and inverted text). When images are indexed, they may turn up several results. For example, the indexing system may look at a word and decide that it is either ?cat"", ?bat?, or ?3at?.

The best way to ensure that handwriting, specifically, is found and indexed is to follow these guidelines:

The clearer the handwriting, the more likely it will be accurately indexed for search. If the penmanship is difficult to read, then Evernote will have a much harder time discerning the written words.
Keep in mind that, instead of generating a single match for a given handwritten word, Evernote will generate several possible matches for the word. For example, the word ""flat"" as written in a JPG might be indexed as ""flat"", ""float"" or ""fiat"".
Currently, Evernote can index 28 typewritten languages and 11 handwritten languages. You can choose which language is used when indexing by changing the Recognition Language setting in your "

Take notes,"You can keep pretty much any type of content in a note. Here are some ideas to get you started:

File attachments

Create tasks
Create tasks in Evernote to keep track of your to-do lists and action items. Tasks are kept in context with your project ideas, meeting notes, and important documents. Or, keep miscellaneous and unsorted tasks in your default task note to be completed or sorted later. Visit Create a task to get started.

Default task note
Notes are the core of Evernote, so it only makes sense that tasks should live within the body of a note. You can insert tasks in any note, new or existing. Or, use your default task note.

Default task note icon (a note with a star icon)

Tasks that have yet to be sorted, miscellaneous tasks that don't seem to fit in a note, or tasks created outside of a note using the + New button, can be saved in your default task note. Your default task note is located in your default notebook and is initially titled, ""Things to do.""

You can treat this note like any other note in your account?change the title, move it to a different notebook, share it, and more.

You can identify the default task note in your note list or in the Tasks view by the starred note icon next to the note title.

To change your default task note, open the Tasks view, click the three dots in the upper right corner, click Default task note..., then select a new note. Alternatively, on Mac, Windows, or Web, click the Settings button (gear) next to your name at the top of the left navigation menu, go to Preferences > Tasks, and select a note from the dropdown options. You cannot select a note that was created by another person and shared with you."
